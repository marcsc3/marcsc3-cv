## Description
This is my personal resume website built with React and Redux. I am using <a href="https://github.com/tbakerx">@timbakerx</a> React resume website template that can be found <a href="https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template">HERE</a>, but I replaced jQuery, trying to keep the same functionalities with React. 

I am the owner of all photos used.
